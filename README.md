# employee-database

## Description

This project is a CLI application mainly using sql where users can View, Add or Update Employees, Departments and Roles.
The technologies used for this project were mysql, mysql2 and node.js.
The hardest part of this project was trying to implement add and update functions and getting them to work.
A feature I would like to add in the future is a function for deleting an employee from the database.
